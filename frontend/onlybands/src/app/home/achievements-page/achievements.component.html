                    Our very first experience on a big stage
                    with a completely random crowd of
                    people from the hosting university, 
                    BITS pilani. Playing three songs for the
                    battle of the bands that night. 
                    Representing our home university 
                    BathSpa RAK.

                    Seeking more thrill and experience, we
                    started looking for more opportunities 
                    outside our university’s scope and 
                    dipped our toes into a well known 
                    Filipino seasonal event in Muraqabat, 
                    Dubai. Playing simple modern and
                    classic opm pop taught us valuable 
                    lessons from the OG’s who guided us 
                    throughout.

                    One of our most popular performances
                    to date. Giving the new students of
                    BathSpa RAK an explosive welcome to
                    what they’re going to now call home in
                    the next 3 years. Using our forte in the
                    pop/punk genre, we definitely gave a
                    competition worthy performance.
